TL;DR:
For all I (July Tikhonov) care, this project is in the public domain.

This project is designed to manipulate blueprint strings generated by
the Desynced game.
The game itself is developed by Stage Games Inc. and
published by Forklift Interactive:
https://store.steampowered.com/app/1450900/Desynced_Autonomous_Colony_Simulator/

This project was developed independently, without any coordination with
the game developers.

The project contains a partial reimplementation of Lua 5.4 hash function and
hash table algorithm.
Lua 5.4 is distributed under MIT license:
https://www.lua.org/license.html

MIT license requires that it should be included in
any “copies or substantial portions” of the Lua language.
This is not, in my unqualified opinion, a “substantial portion” of
the Lua language.

I am putting this project in the public domain.
No warranties are provided, including legal or technical.
You can use it without any restrictions, unless you think that any of
the above notices should prevent you from that.
